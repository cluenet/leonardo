# leonardo

Leonardo is a rewrite of the DaVinci bot that runs on the
[ClueNet](http://cluenet.org) IRC network. If you haven't heard of
that, this project is probably not that interesting to you.

Leonardo is a bot that gives points for
[Clueful Chatting][clueful-chatting]. If you talk well, the bot will
award you, and if you talk poorly, the bot will give you a bad score.
You don't have to have an activated account to start getting points
from Leonardo. Your points will be carried over when your account is
activated, as long as your nickname doesn't change.
